# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - PyTorch
This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

# Overview
The mnist_cnn_model.py script contains the code for defining, training, and testing the CNN model. This model architecture consists of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers for classification.
